# Local setup (MacOS users)

The local setup has two pre-requisites:

- [`Pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) for managing Python installations.
- [`Poetry`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) as dependency management tool and for setting up virtual environments.

## Setup `Pyenv`

1. Install `Pyenv`

```bash
       brew update
       brew install pyenv pyenv-virtualenv
```

2. Configure the terminal environment to use `Pyenv`

```
echo 'eval "$(pyenv init --path)"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

> Do the same for `~/.zshrc` if using [`Oh My Zsh`](https://ohmyz.sh/).

3. Install Python 3.11 and set it as Python version for the project.

```
pyenv install 3.12
pyenv local 3.12
```

4. Check the default Python version is the one set in step 3

```
python --version
python -c "import sys;print(sys.executable)"
```

## Install `Poetry`

1. Execute the following command in the `Terminal`:

```
pip install poetry
```

## Install the package and its dependencies

Assuming that the Poetry setup is in place, you can simply run the command:

```
poetry install
```

## Coding guidelines

All contributed code must adhere to the following guidelines.

- Code style
- Code is formated and linted using a variety of packages such as Black, Pylint, Flake8, Isort, Pydocstyle, among others.

- Pre-commit hooks
- There are pre-commit hooks in place that ensure the code style is met before committing. Such pre-commit hooks are run via the command:

```
poetry run pre-commit run -a
```

- Source code should be unit tests. A test coverage report is generated by running:

```
poetry run coverage run --source=src -m pytest -v tests && poetry run coverage report -m
```

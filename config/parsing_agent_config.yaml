  You are an expert at extracting structured product information from HTML content.

  Your task is to analyze the provided HTML content and extract product information. 
    Focus on identifying individual products and their key attributes.

  **EXTRACTION GUIDELINES:**
  1. **Product Name**: Extract the complete product name/title, excluding extra labels
  2. **Price**: Extract exact price information (single price like '$29.95' or range like '$19.95 - $39.95')
  3. **Product ID**: Look for product IDs, SKUs, or data attributes (data-product-id, etc.)
  4. **Image URL**: Extract image URLs (src attributes from img tags)
  5. **Description**: Extract product descriptions, features, or specifications

  **IMPORTANT RULES:**
  - Only extract information that is clearly visible in the HTML
  - If a field is not available or unclear, set it to null
  - Be precise with price extraction - include currency symbols
  - For product names, extract the main title but exclude labels like "Top Rated", "REI OUTLET"
  - Look for structural patterns to identify where one product ends and another begins
  - Each product should be a separate entry in the results

  **HTML CONTENT TO ANALYZE:**
  {html_content}

  **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
  {format_instructions}

  Extract all distinct products you can identify from this HTML content:

#   <user>
#     <context>
#     Fields to extract: {fields}
#     Resources: {web_resource}
#     </context>
#
#     <extraction_requirements>
#     1. Process ALL provided resources sequentially
#     2. Extract ONLY the specified fields - ignore unrelated content[16]
#     3. Return empty strings for fields that cannot be confidently extracted[11][22]
#     4. Maintain consistent data formatting across extractions
#     5. Preserve original text formatting when extracting content values
#     </extraction_requirements>
#
#     <validation_rules>
#     - Ensure all specified fields are present in output JSON structure
#     - Verify extracted values match expected data types for each field
#     - Confirm JSON syntax validity before returning response[14]
#     - Apply content sanitization for HTML entities and special characters
#     </validation_rules>
